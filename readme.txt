The shared data includes the following matlab files:

- behavioral_nostim_SCZ_data.mat
- modelling_SCZ_data.mat
- Bayes_SCZ_data.mat
- Bayes_P_SCZ_data.mat
- lapse_estimations_75_split_SCZ_data.mat

Each of these files are explained in more detail below. 

To reproduce the results using these data files run master_code_SCZ.m  

- behavioral_stim_SCZ_data.mat 
	contains 5 measures of performance on stimulus trials organized as 43x9 matrices 
	for 43 participants and 9 stimulus motion directions [-64 -48 -32 -16 0 16 32 48 64]).
	The first 23 rows are controls, while the remaining 20 are patients. 
	The variables include:
		- MU - estimation bias
		- SIGMA - estimation variability (standard deviation)
		- B - random lapse estimations
		- RT - estimation reaction time
		- Det - detection rate of presented stimulus
		
	This data is used for producing Figure 2 and for mixed ANOVA analysis in SPSS; and for Figure 7. 
	
	    
- behavioral_nostim_SCZ_data.mat
	contains 3 measures for no-stimulus trials organized into 43 cells, one for each participant.
	The first 23 cells are controls, while the remaining 20 are patients.
	The variables include:
		- nd - estimation directions (in radians) for when stimulus was reported 
		- nun - estimation directions (in radians) for when no stimulus was reported 
		- na - all estimation directions (nun and nd combined)  
		
	This data is used for producing Figure 3 and Figure 7.	
	
	
- modelling_SCZ_data.mat
	contains data used for model comparison of the 8 models organized as 43x8 matrices
	for 43 participants and 8 models (BAYES_P, BAYES, BAYES_varmin, BAYES_var, ADD1, ADD1m, ADD2, ADD2m).
	The first 23 cells are controls, while the remaining 20 are patients.
	The variables include:
		- BIC - Bayesian Information Criteria
		- log_evidence - model log evidence based on BIC approximation
		- model_type - a cell with model labels
	
	This data is used for producing Figure 5.
	
	
- Bayes_P_SCZ_data.mat
	contains model parameter values and behavioral predictions generated by the BAYES_P model.
	Matrices with 43 rows: the first 23 cells are controls, while the remaining 20 are patients.
	The variables include:
		- params - MLE estimates of the BAYES_P parameter values
		- params_names - parameters' labels (theta_expected, sigma_expected, sigma_sensory, alpha_prior-based)
		- bias_m - estimation bias by the model
		- std_m - estimation variability (standard deviation) by the model
		- lapses_m - lapse estimations by the model

 - Bayes_SCZ_data.mat
	contains behavioral predictions generated by the BAYES model.
	Matrices with 43 rows: the first 23 cells are controls, while the remaining 20 are patients.
	The variables include:
		- bias_b - estimation bias by the model
		- std_b - estimation variability (standard deviation) by the model
		- lapses_b - lapse estimations by the model
		
	This data is used for producing Figure 5.


- lapses_75_split_SCZ_data.mat
	contains the lapse estimations on stimulus trials split across 75% detection threshold
	based on individual psychometric curves.
	43x5 matrices for 43 participants and 5 stimulus motion directions [0 16 32 48 64] (data folded across 0)
	The variables include:
		- alpha_above75 - lapse estimations above the 75% detection threshold
		- alpha_below75 - lapse estimations below the 75% detection threshold
		
	This data is used for producing Figure 7.
